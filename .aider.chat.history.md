#### Code the following app

#### Give a new English word + meaning + example  
#### ```  
####   
#### Generate an app logo and update the app metadata title and description.  

The following files are the ones that will most likely need to be edited or added to satisfy the requests:

1. `mini-app/lib/metadata.ts` – update the `title` and `description` values.  
2. `mini-app/public/logo.png.todo` – create a new `.todo` file to generate the app logo.  
3. `mini-app/components/word.tsx` – create a new component that displays a new English word, its meaning, and an example sentence.  
4. `mini-app/app/page.tsx` – import the new `Word` component so it is rendered on the home page.  

Please add these files to the chat so I can provide the exact *SEARCH/REPLACE* blocks.

A stylized, modern logo featuring a stylized letter "W" intertwined with a stylized letter "D" in a bold, vibrant gradient of blue and green. The background is a clean, light gray with subtle geometric patterns. The logo should convey a sense of creativity, learning, and daily discovery, suitable for a word‑of‑the‑day application. The overall composition is balanced and eye‑catching, with the letters slightly overlapping to suggest connection and continuity.
